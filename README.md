# Amazon User ExperienceðŸ’¡

_Note: I duplicated a new repository so this project is accessible publicly._

For our INFO 2950 Introduction to Data Science course final project, my group member, Ashley Chiang, and I tested our hypothesises about the correlation between Amazon user experience and consumer willingness of purchasing products in different age groups with Train/test set, Feature Selection, Multicollinearity, OLS Multi-Linear Regression Model training, K-Fold Cross Validation, and RMSE.

Below are the files needed to access our project.
