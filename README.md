# Amazon User ExperienceðŸ’¡

For our INFO 2950 Introduction to Data Science course final project, my group member, Ashley Chiang, and I tested our hypothesises about the correlation between Amazon user experience and consumer willingness of purchasing products in different age groups with Train/test set, Feature Selection, Multicollinearity, OLS Multi-Linear Regression Model training, K-Fold Cross Validation, and RMSE.

Research Questions:
1. Do higher levels of helpfulness of Amazon reviews, helpfulness of Amazon recommendations, or personalized recommendations correlate with the higher frequency of users adding items to their shopping carts?
2. Do higher levels of helpfulness of Amazon reviews, helpfulness of Amazon recommendations, or personalized recommendations correlate with the higher frequency of users completing shopping cart purchases?
3. Do people who find the reviews helpful have a higher frequency of adding items to their cart among different age groups?

In this project, we would like to investigate if there is a correlation between x-variables (review helpfulness, recommendation helpfulness, frequency of receiving personalized product recommendations) and each y-variable (the frequency of adding items to cart and the frequency of cart completion). In addition, we would like to analyze the correlation of x-variables and y-variables in different age groups. The age groups include *13-18, 19-25, 26-40, 41-64, and 65+*.
